When a profile is created on the client, the security level of all information is raised to the current client level to ensure that the user’s sensitive data such as name, age, gender and interests are safe when transmitting to the server.
When data arrives at the server, the server will automatically forward the profile to the agent. As is requested, the server doesn’t declassify any information from the message. The agent, running with ”let pini authoriy”, can read and declassify needed information in the profile and returns the result. The result of a match is judged by the first element in the tuple come from the agents. When both are true, that means match is successful, the client will resend a profile that has processed the security label to the server. and the server sends profile to each other.
